			'The WA73 delivers up to 80dB of gain and includes custom Carnhill transformers specifically designed to recreate the sweet saturation and vintage tone of the original. Tantalum and polystyrene capacitors are also in use in the signal path providing smoother performance at high gain settings than any other â€˜73 clone.',

			'The PRE-73 MKIII is a one-channel vintage style microphone-, line- and instrument preamplifier. The signal path uses only discrete components like resistors, capacitors and transistors. The in- and output is transformer balanced, using two different transformers, each one optimized for its purpose. This is the way audio components were built before integrated circuits became available.',

		description:
			'The RNC is a compact which provides two modes of operation: normal and SuperNice. Normal mode allows the RNC to be used for everyday compression tasks, like punchy snare drums or bass guitars, and is great for everything from gentle compression to serious squashing. SuperNice mode provides near-invisible signal compression for sensitive material where compression artifacts are less desirable (like vocals, acoustic guitar or the program bus). The RNC yields clean, airy compression with few artifacts and little high end loss, even at massive gain reduction.',
